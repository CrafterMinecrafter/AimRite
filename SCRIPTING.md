# Scripting
Don't worry about this file. This is just notes for me so I can make scripts for other champions.  
You can make your own scripts aswell, it's pretty simple. I'll go into depth on how to do it later, but for now, this is just notes for me.  
Please do note if you decide to use this (and actually understand it), all these values are rough and most likely not 100% accurate, this is just the values I got from eyeballing.

#### Global Values  
- Offset Unlocked: 40~46
- OFfset Locked: 74~80
- Camera Locked Range: 200.0f
- Camera Locked Range Visibility: 180.0f
- Camera Unlocked Range: 540.0f
- Camera Unlocked Range Visibility: 254.0f  
Wtf? Locked and unlocked range has different visibility ranges? Maybe I did this wrong? Or maybe it's more op to use unlocked camera? Have to double check this lol.
